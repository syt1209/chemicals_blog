## Introduction
PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a group of man-made chemicals that have been used in various consumer and industrial products for several decades. These chemicals are resistant to heat, water, and oil, which makes them useful in products such as non-stick cookware, food packaging, and waterproof clothing. However, the widespread use of PFAS has led to contamination of soil, air, and water sources in many parts of the world, including Canada.

## Discovery of PFAS

PFAS were first discovered in the 1930s, when chemists were working on developing new materials that could resist heat, water, and oil. The first known PFAS compound, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), was discovered by a DuPont chemist in 1947.

DuPont, along with other companies, began using PFAS in various products, including non-stick cookware, food packaging, and firefighting foam. These products were widely adopted due to their resistance to heat, water, and oil.

However, it was not until the 1990s that concerns about the potential health and environmental risks of PFAS began to emerge. A series of studies conducted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revealed that PFAS were present in the blood of the general population and that exposure to these chemicals could lead to serious health risks.

In response to these concerns, the EPA launched an investigation into the use and environmental impact of PFAS. This investigation revealed that PFAS were present in many areas of the environment, including water sources near industrial facilities and military bases where firefighting foam containing PFAS was used.

## Risks of PFAS Contamination in Canada

Studies have shown that exposure to PFAS can lead to serious health risks. These include an increased risk of cancer, thyroid disease, and developmental and reproductive issues. PFAS can also interfere with the immune system, which can result in reduced vaccine efficacy and increased susceptibility to infections.

PFAS contamination is a growing concern in Canada, with contamination found in many areas of the country. This contamination is primarily caused by industrial sites such as military bases, airports, and industrial facilities. A 2019 study by Environment and Climate Change Canada found that PFAS contamination was present in soil, water, and air samples from various locations in Canada.

The study revealed that the highest concentrations of PFAS were found near industrial sites and military bases, where firefighting foam containing PFAS was used. In some areas, the levels of PFAS contamination exceeded the federal drinking water guidelines.

This contamination is concerning because PFAS have been linked to a variety of health issues, including developmental effects, liver damage, and increased risk of certain cancers. As a result, there is a growing demand for action to be taken to address PFAS contamination in Canada.


## Regulations and Action Plan

To address the issue of PFAS contamination, the Canadian government has implemented several regulations and initiatives. These include the proposed regulations to limit the use of PFAS in certain products, such as food packaging and firefighting foam. The government has also introduced requirements for the reporting of PFAS use in other products. The Canadian government has also committed to developing guidelines for PFAS in drinking water, as well as launching a national PFAS action plan.

The national PFAS action plan includes several initiatives, including investing in research to better understand the health effects of PFAS, monitoring PFAS in the environment, and developing strategies to manage and reduce PFAS contamination. The government has also committed to working with Indigenous communities to address PFAS contamination on their lands.

In 2021, the government announced the development of a new regulatory framework for PFAS. The framework will establish guidelines for the use and disposal of PFAS and will require companies to report their use of these chemicals.

The government has also launched a $4.5 million research program to investigate the impact of PFAS on the environment and human health. The program will focus on developing methods for detecting and measuring PFAS in the environment and evaluating the effectiveness of remediation technologies.

## Efforts at the Provincial and Municipal Levels

In addition to federal initiatives, provincial and municipal governments in Canada have also taken steps to address PFAS contamination. For example, Quebec has set a drinking water standard for PFAS, and the city of Ottawa has launched a PFAS monitoring program. Other provinces, such as British Columbia and Ontario, have also introduced initiatives to address PFAS contamination.

At the provincial level, some Canadian provinces have taken steps to address PFAS contamination by introducing their own initiatives. For example, British Columbia has introduced a regulatory approach to manage PFAS in drinking water. The province's Drinking Water Protection Act requires water suppliers to regularly monitor for PFAS and report any exceedances of the province's drinking water guidelines.

Ontario has also taken action to address PFAS contamination by developing a PFAS Action Plan. The plan includes initiatives such as monitoring and testing of drinking water sources, research on the health and environmental impacts of PFAS, and engagement with communities affected by PFAS contamination.

In addition, Ontario has set up a PFAS Science Table to provide scientific advice to the government on issues related to PFAS. The Science Table has been tasked with identifying areas where further research is needed and providing recommendations for addressing PFAS contamination.

At the municipal level, several Canadian cities have also taken steps to address PFAS contamination. For example, the City of Ottawa has launched a PFAS monitoring program to test its drinking water sources for the presence of PFAS. The program includes testing of both raw and treated water, as well as testing of groundwater sources.

In Vancouver, the City has developed a plan to address PFAS contamination from firefighting foam. The plan includes a ban on the use of firefighting foam containing PFAS and the implementation of a program to collect and properly dispose of any existing stocks of the foam.

Overall, the actions taken by federal, provincial, and municipal governments in Canada demonstrate a growing awareness of the risks associated with PFAS contamination and a commitment to addressing this issue. However, much more work is needed to fully understand the risks of PFAS and develop effective strategies for managing and remediating contaminated sites.

## Conclusion

PFAS contamination is a serious issue in Canada, with widespread contamination found in soil, water, and air samples. The health risks associated with exposure to PFAS highlight the need for continued efforts to reduce and manage PFAS contamination. The Canadian government, along with provincial and municipal governments, is taking steps to address this issue. It is essential for individuals and communities to stay informed about the risks of PFAS and take steps to limit exposure where possible.
