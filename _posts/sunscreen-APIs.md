## Introduction
Sunscreens are an important part of daily life for many people, helping to protect skin from the harmful effects of UV radiation. Active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, are the compounds in sunscreens that provide this protection. The most common APIs in sunscreens include both physical and chemical filters, each with unique properties and benefits. In this list, we provide an overview of 20 of the most commonly used APIs in sunscreens, including their chemical information, as well as three popular sunscreen products that contain each API. By understanding the different APIs used in sunscreens, consumers can make informed decisions about which products are best suited for their individual needs and preferences.

## 20 APIs in Sunscreens
Here is comprehensive list of APIs used in sunscreens, which include   two (2) physical (also known as mineral) sunscreen ingredients (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) and eighteen (18) chemical sunscreen ingredients.
1. [Oxybenzone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/4632)
2. [Avobenzone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Avobenzone)
3. [Octinoxate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/octinoxate)
4. [Homosalate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Homosalate)
5. [Octisalate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Octisalate)
6. [Zinc oxide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Zinc-oxide)
7. [Titanium dioxide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Titanium-dioxide)
8. [Mexoryl SX (ecamsule)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/mexoryl-sx)
9. [Tinosorb S (bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Bemotrizinol)
10. [Tinosorb M (methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Methylene-bis-benzotriazolyl-tetramethylbutylphenol)
11. [Uvinul A Plus (diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/diethylamino-hydroxybenzoyl-hexyl-benzoate)
12. [Uvinul T 150 (ethylhexyl triazone)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/octyl-triazone)
13. [Polycrylene (polyester-8)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5350909)
14. [Meradimate (menthyl anthranilate)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Meradimate)
15. [Dioxybenzone (benzophenone-8)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/9677)
16. [Ensulizole (phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ensulizole)
17. [Sulisobenzone (benzophenone-4)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5361376)
18. [Ecamsule (Mexoryl XL)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Mexoryl-XL)
19. [Helioplex (avobenzone, oxybenzone, and others; trademarked name for a proprietary sunscreen technology developed by the Johnson & Johnson company.)](https://www.neutrogena.com/articles/sun/helioplex-technology-explained.html)
20. [Octyl triazone (ethylhexyl triazone)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/160968)

It's worth noting that some of these ingredients may not be approved for use in all countries, and regulations regarding sunscreen ingredients can vary depending on the region. Additionally, some of these ingredients, such as oxybenzone, have been associated with potential environmental and health concerns, leading to a growing interest in more natural and mineral-based sunscreens.

## APIs not approved for use in sunscreens in Canada
Specifically, the following three are not approved for use in sunscreens in Canada:

1.  Mexoryl SX (ecamsule)
2.  Tinosorb S (bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine)
3.  Tinosorb M (methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol)

The three ingredients that are not approved for use in sunscreens in Canada, Mexoryl SX (ecamsule), Tinosorb S (bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine), and Tinosorb M (methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol), have not been approved because they were not included in the list of approved sunscreen ingredients under the Canadian Sunscreen Monograph.

The Sunscreen Monograph is a set of regulations that governs the sale and marketing of sunscreens in Canada. It outlines the requirements that sunscreens must meet in order to be sold in Canada, including the allowable active ingredients, their concentration levels, and other product labeling and testing requirements.

In order for an ingredient to be included in the Sunscreen Monograph, it must undergo a rigorous review process by Health Canada to assess its safety and effectiveness for use in sunscreens. The review process for new sunscreen ingredients can be lengthy and complex, requiring multiple rounds of testing and evaluation, and can take several years to complete.

It's worth noting that while these ingredients are not currently approved for use in sunscreens in Canada, they are available in other countries and are considered safe and effective in protecting against UV radiation. Health Canada has been evaluating new sunscreen ingredients, including Mexoryl SX and Tinosorb, for inclusion in the Sunscreen Monograph, and it is possible that they may be approved for use in Canadian sunscreens in the future.

## Summary
In summary, sunscreens contain a range of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including both physical and chemical filters. Each API has its own unique properties and benefits, and consumers should carefully consider their individual needs and preferences when choosing a sunscreen product. While many APIs have been approved for use in sunscreens in various countries, some APIs, such as PABA and trolamine salicylate, have been banned in certain regions due to concerns about their safety and efficacy. Ultimately, it is important to use sunscreens as directed and to reapply regularly in order to maximize their protective benefits and minimize the risk of sun damage and skin cancer.
