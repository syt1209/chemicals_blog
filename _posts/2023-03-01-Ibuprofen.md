## Introduction

Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation. It was first discovered in the 1960s and has since become one of the most widely used over-the-counter medications in the world. This article will cover the discovery and development history of ibuprofen, relevant non-clinical and clinical studies, the production process, impact on human health, impact on the environment, and a list of products containing ibuprofen approved by Health Canada.

## Discovery and Development History

The discovery of ibuprofen can be traced back to the 1950s when researchers at Boots Pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom began synthesizing a series of compounds that could potentially treat rheumatoid arthritis. In 1961, Stewart Adams, a pharmacologist at Boots, began testing a new compound, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid, which would later become known as ibuprofen. The compound showed promise in reducing inflammation and pain without the side effects associated with other drugs at the time, such as aspirin and corticosteroids.

In 1969, ibuprofen was first approved for medical use in the United Kingdom. It was later approved in other countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. Since its approval, ibuprofen has become one of the most widely used drugs in the world.

## Non-Clinical and Clinical Studies

Non-clinical studies have shown that ibuprofen works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By inhibiting prostaglandin production, ibuprofen can reduce pain and inflammation without affecting the blood's ability to clot, unlike aspirin.

Clinical studies have shown that ibuprofen is effective in treating pain, fever, and inflammation caused by conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, menstrual cramps, and headaches. It is also commonly used to relieve pain and fever associated with the common cold and flu. However, like all drugs, ibuprofen can cause side effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney damage, and allergic reactions.

## Production Process

Ibuprofen can be synthesized by several different methods. One of the most common methods involves the reaction of isobutylbenzene with propionic anhydride to form ibuprofen. The reaction is typically carried out in the presence of a catalyst, such as sulfuric acid, and requires several steps to purify the final product.

## Impact on Human Health

Ibuprofen is generally considered safe when used as directed. However, long-term use or misuse can cause serious health problems, including gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney damage, and increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Individuals with a history of stomach ulcers, heart disease, or kidney problems should avoid using ibuprofen without first consulting with their healthcare provider.

## Impact on the Environment

Ibuprofen has been detected in surface waters, groundwater, and wastewater treatment plant effluents. While ibuprofen is not considered highly toxic to aquatic organisms, long-term exposure can affect the behavior and reproduction of certain species. Additionally, some studies have suggested that ibuprofen may interfere with the endocrine system of fish, leading to the feminization of male fish.

## List of Products Containing Ibuprofen Approved by Health Canada

Ibuprofen is available over-the-counter in Canada and is also included in many prescription medications. Some common products containing ibuprofen approved by Health Canada include:
- Advil
- Motrin
- Nurofen
- Rufen
- Brufen

## Conclusion

Ibuprofen is a popular NSAID that is widely used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation. Its discovery and development history can be traced back to the 1960s, and it has since become one of the most widely used over-the-counter medications in the world. Non-clinical and clinical studies have shown that ibuprofen is effective in treating a wide range of conditions, but it can cause side effects if not used as directed. Ibuprofen has also been detected in surface waters, groundwater, and wastewater treatment plant effluents, and studies have shown that long-term exposure can affect aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, ibuprofen continues to be an important drug in modern medicine, and it remains a widely available and accessible medication for millions of people worldwide.
